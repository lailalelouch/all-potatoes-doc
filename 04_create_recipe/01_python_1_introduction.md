In this chapter you'll be creating the create page for the recipe. This page will be slightly special because we won't be just using forms as we normally do. This form will have a bit of a twist.

Before we actually start with the creation of this page with its very special form. We'll give you a tester of how this form will look like through modifying the admin page to look like the form that we want to do.

Why are we modifying the admin page and not doing the form directly?

Great question...glad you asked.

Simply becase it is a 100 times easier to modify the admin page into what we want than doing the actual form and it'll help you understand what we're trying to achgieve later on when we do the actual form.

If you go to the live demo and open the [add recipe page](https://crumblemumble.codeunicorn.io/create/recipe/), it should give you a good idea on what your trying to build.
