In this chapter, we'll be creating a button in the recipe details page. When the user presses this button a pdf file with the recipe should be downloaded.

The library we'll be using to make this work is [easy_pdf](https://django-easy-pdf.readthedocs.io/).

Open the documentation and take a look at it before going to the next section.


## Trello
> Move card `As a logged in user, I can download a recipe in pdf format.` from the `Backlog` to the `Doing` list.
