This is the chapter where we start tweaking the project. Just adding little things here and there to give the user a better user experience. So, we'll be doing 3 things:
 
 * Add a search bar to allow the user to search for a certain recipe. (search bar in the live demo)
 * Allow the user to filter the recipes list by category. (list page in the live demo)
 * Allow the user to specify the required portion for a recipe. (recipe details page in the live demo)
