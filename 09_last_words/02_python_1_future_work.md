To help you continue to build your skills, I have a few suggestions to help you build on what you've already learned.

If you want to improve this website, you can add more features to it. For example:

 * Have two kind of users, normal and premium.
 * Normal users can only save up to 10 recipes.
 * Only premium users can export to pdf.
 * Add ratings and reviews to the recipes (you'll need to add new models).
 * Allow the users to have the choice to search by name or by an ingredient in the recipe.

These are just ideas on how you can build on this project. You can start doing those ideas or you can come up with ideas of your own and actually make something out of it.


On the other hand, If you'd like to work on something else to improve your skills in django, could suggest [My Rent](https://codeunicorn.io/p/my-rent). This project will build on the skills that you've gained here and go one step further into integrating payment and sms services.
 

At the same time, if you liked the idea of making a website dynamic you could start by jumping into a more frontend focused project, these projects will give you the starting point:

 * [can you remember?](https://codeunicorn.io/p/can-you-remember).
 * [popo the worker](https://codeunicorn.io/p/popo-the-worker).
