As the name suggests, I just wanted to congratulate you on the great effort you've put into finishing this project. You've learned alot in this one project. 


Take the time to let it all sink in. Go through your code again and try to experiment with new things or new pages that you can add to this website just so you can apply what you've learned but on your own.


In this project you've learned the following:

 * Create more complex forms.
 * Use javascript to make a website more dynamic.
 * How to export data onto a pdf.
