In this chapter, you've done two things. Create the action of saving a recipe and creating the page that shows the list of saved recipes. To finish this functionality, we had to do the following:
 * Create a new `SavedRecipe` model.
 * Create a page that shows all the recipes that the logged in user saved.
 * Add a button in the recipes details page that triggers a javascript function to save/unsave the recipe without reloading the page.


Test everything that you've done in this chpater and make sure that it's working properly. Also, I'd recommend that you take the time to style things a bit, but that's up to you.


## Git

Create a new checkpoint

```shell
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "finished saving recipes functionality"
$ git push
```
