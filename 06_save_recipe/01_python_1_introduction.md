In this chapter, we'll be adding a button to the recipes details page. When the user presses on this button, this recipe should be saved for this user and the user can access all of his saved recipes on a seperate page. Go to any recipe in the live demo and save it and you'll see it in the saved recipes page, this is what we're going to build in this chapter.


You can even make it more interesting by allowing each user to save a specific number of recipes or a user can only save as many recipes as they've added to the website. I'll leave this for you to think about. Enjoy


We'll be starting with creating the saved recipes page first. So, start by moving this card.

## Trello
> Move card `As a logged in user, I can see a list of saved recipes` from the `Backlog` to the `Doing` list.
