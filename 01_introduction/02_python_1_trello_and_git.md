In this project you'll be using both `trello` and `git`.


#### Trello

`Trello` is a tool used to help you manage your work. It will allow you to keep track of what you need to do, what you've already finished, and so on.

Open the projects `Trello` board which you'll find in the `Resources` section. In the board you'll find 5 lists:

* `IceBox`: This list has all the cards/functionalities that are nice to have but not necessary (iceboxed).
* `Backlog`: This list has all the cards/functionalities that we need to do.
* `Doing`: This list will have all the cards/functionalities that you are currently working on.
* `Review`: This list will have all the cards/functionalities that you finished, but need to be reviewed by someone.
* `Done`: This list will have all the cards/functionalities that are complete and reviewed.


Right now all the cards are in the `backlog` list, because we haven't started working on the project. So, as we start working in this project, we'll be moving the cards to different lists.

#### Git

We'll be using `git` throughout the project to keep track of the changes we're making to the code. We will also create checkpoints everytime we finish a functionality.

We're not going to start this project from scratch, so there is a starter project for you. After you fork and clone this project, each time we complete a certain functionality we'll push to that repo.
