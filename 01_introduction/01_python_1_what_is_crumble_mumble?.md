Crumble mumble is a electronic recipes book, where all users can share their recipes with the world. Why? Because sharing is caring!

While some people may not be so keen on the sharing their recipes, they can use this as a place to keep all their recipes for themselves. The website will organize the recipes by category to allow users to navigate through them easily. It will also help users manage their recipe portions.

This project will have a bit of JavaScript in it, so **bear** with me (pun not intended).
