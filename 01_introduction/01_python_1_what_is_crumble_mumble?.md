Crumble mumble is a basically an electronic recipes book where all users can share their recipes with the world because sharing is caring.

While others may not be so keen on the sharing idea and they just want a place to keep all their recipes for themselves. 

The website will help organize their recipes by category to allow them to navigate through them and just help them with managing the recipes portions.

This project will have a bit of javascript in it so **bear** with me (pun not intended).
