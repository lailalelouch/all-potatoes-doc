Crumble mumble is a basically an electronic recipes book where all users can share their recipes with the world because sharing is caring.

While others may not be so keen on sharing their idea and they just want a place to store all their recipes for themselves. 

The website will help organize their recipes by category to allow them to navigate through them, as well as help them with managing the recipe portions.

This project will have a bit of javascript in it so **bear** with me (Pun not intended... Maybe).


If you'd like to know exactly what features we're building, you can take a look at the [trello board](https://trello.com/b/bMCHXMOP/crumble-mumble) provided and use it to follow along. Feel free to add some features to the icebox and build them yourself at the end of this project.
