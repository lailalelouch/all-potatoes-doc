The project has two apps:

 * authentication: everything authentication related is here
 * recipes: everything recipe related is here.

These are the things that are already written in the starter project:

1. Models
2. Registering models to admin page.
3. A `base` file.
3. recipes list page.
4. recipe details page.
5. my recipes page.
5. Authentication: login, register, and logout.

I'm making the assumption that you already know how of these work and how they're done. However, if any of these seem confusing, this chapter will have a short explanation for all of them.

I'd recommend that you take the time to read through the starter project and try to make sense of it on your own. If everything makes sense, you can skip all the sections in this chapter and just go to the next one. Otherwise, the next few sections are for you.
